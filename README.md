# ITSC3155FinalProject

Final project for ITSC 3155.

A MySQL, Flask, and SQLAlchemy forum website geared around the discussion of various CS topic.

You need to rename config_example.py to config.py and fill the variables with appropriate values. 

You also need a running MySQL server for this web app to function.

Install the requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt

after that, assuming you intiated the schema into a database using a tool like MySQL workbench, you should be able to run and use the app freely.
